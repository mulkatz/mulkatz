I've built 20+ side projects. None of them made me rich. I'm still building.

My projects folder looks like the browser tabs of someone who's lost control
of their life — mobile apps, SaaS tools, AI experiments, things nobody asked for
but I built anyway.

I'm good at making things. Marketing? Let's call it a growth area.

## Projects

- 🧬 **[mycel](https://github.com/mulkatz/mycel)** — AI knowledge engine that talks to people and structures what they know. Multi-agent pipeline, RAG, schema evolution — the whole thing.
- 🌐 **[mycel-web](https://github.com/mulkatz/mycel-web)** — Frontend for Mycel. Chat UI, Admin Dashboard, React 19 + Tailwind CSS v4.
- ⚒️ **[anvil](https://github.com/mulkatz/anvil)** — I got tired of AI agreeing with everything I say, so I built a plugin that argues back.
- 📸 **[cap2cal](https://github.com/mulkatz/cap2cal)** — Snap a photo of an event poster and it ends up in your calendar. Because typing dates manually is beneath us.

More things are cooking. I'm building in public now — open-sourcing projects,
sharing what I learn, and writing about what actually happens when you ship stuff
into the void.

If that sounds like your kind of mess — follow along.
