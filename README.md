### Hey, I'm Franz

I build things. Too many things, probably.

My ~/Workspace has more abandoned repos than a shelter has cats — which is ironic,
because my username literally means cat. Most of my projects start with
"what if I just..." and end somewhere between MVP and mass adoption delusion.

Sometimes they actually ship, though:

- [anvil](https://github.com/mulkatz/anvil) — I got tired of AI agreeing
  with everything I say, so I built a plugin that argues back.
  Adversarial thinking for Claude Code.
- [cap2cal](https://github.com/mulkatz/cap2cal) — Snap a photo of an event
  poster and it ends up in your calendar. Because typing dates manually
  is a mass psychosis we've accepted for too long.

Currently exploring the intersection of AI tooling and developer workflows.
Previously shipped mobile games, chat platforms, and various things
that mass-adopted exactly zero users.

Stack doesn't matter, but since you're asking:
TypeScript everywhere, React, Node, Firebase, Flutter when mobile,
and whatever AI API dropped this week.
