### Hey, I'm Franz

I've built 20+ side projects. None of them made me rich. I'm still building.

My projects folder looks like the browser tabs of someone who's lost control
of their life — mobile apps, SaaS tools, AI experiments, things nobody asked for
but I built anyway.

I'm good at making things. Marketing? Let's call it a growth area.

Here are some recent ones:

- [mycel](https://github.com/mulkatz/mycel) — An AI knowledge engine that talks to
  people and structures what they know. Multi-agent pipeline, RAG, schema evolution —
  the whole thing. [Frontend](https://github.com/mulkatz/mycel-web) is React + Tailwind.
- [anvil](https://github.com/mulkatz/anvil) — I got tired of AI agreeing with
  everything I say, so I built a plugin that argues back.
- [cap2cal](https://github.com/mulkatz/cap2cal) — Snap a photo of an event poster
  and it ends up in your calendar. Because typing dates manually is beneath us.

More things are cooking. I'm building in public now — open-sourcing projects,
sharing what I learn, and writing about what actually happens when you ship stuff
into the void.

If that sounds like your kind of mess — follow along.

Stack: TypeScript everywhere, React, Node, Firebase, Flutter when mobile,
and whatever AI API dropped this week.
